# About Compatible Foods
A simple app made with Vue.js. It's just a group of radio buttons that allows you to select foods. Incompatible foods are disabled depending on the selected foods. It is just a simple app but it demonstrate my skills on Vue.js.
This is one of the challenge given to me by a company I applied in.
